The solution is to let a robber-baron own the land that used to be everyone’s, because once he’s running it for profit, he’ll take exquisite care to generate profit forever.” “That’s the tragedy of the commons? A fairy tale about giving public assets to rich people to run as personal empires because that way they’ll make sure they’re better managed than they would be if we just made up some rules?",

Some level of profit may be acceptable in the early stages, or when necessary for expansion, but if a corporation has swelled to billion-dollar heights and is still turning to new frontiers to maintain profit margins, that’s a problem. At that stage, profit should be attributed to some combination of these distasteful possibilities: workers being underpaid; customers being fleeced; environment or social externalities being ignored; or monopolization of intellectual property. Profit should be treated as a sign that the system is in need of correction.",

      "quote": "Exchange allows us to cancel out our debts. It gives us a way to call it even: hence, to end the relationship. With vendors, one is usually only pretending to have a relationship at all. With neighbors, one might for this very reason prefer not to pay one’s debts. Laura Bohanan writes about arriving in a Tiv community in rural Nigeria; neighbors immediately began arriving bearing little gifts: “two ears corn, one vegetable marrow, one chicken, five tomatoes, one handful peanuts.” Having no idea what was expected of her, she thanked them and wrote down in a notebook their names and what they had brought. Eventually, two women adopted her and explained that all such gifts did have to be returned. It would be entirely inappropriate to simply accept three eggs from a neighbor and never bring anything back. One did not have to bring back eggs, but one should bring something back of approximately the same value. One could even bring money—there was nothing inappropriate in that—provided one did so at a discreet interval and above all, that one did not bring the exact cost of the eggs. It had to either be a bit more or a bit less. To bring back nothing at all would be to cast oneself as an exploiter or a parasite. To bring back an exact equivalent would be to suggest that one no longer wishes to have anything to do with the neighbor. Tiv women, she learned, might spend a good part of the day walking for miles to distant homesteads to return a handful of okra or a tiny bit of change, “in an endless circle of gifts to which no one ever handed over the precise value of the object last received”—and in doing so, they were continually creating their society.",

This is a precaritizing logic that depends on the decomposition of that which was previously whole (the job, the asset, the individual life) so that operations can be moved into a space that’s free of burdensome attaches to the underlying entity, whether that’s the fluctuating price of actual commodities or the frailty of the actual worker.",

Overall, the studies showed that none of the many hundreds of tools that had been developed made any real difference, and that some were in fact potentially harmful (Wynants et all, 2020; Driggs et all, 2021).",
